function Score = jake_score(feat1,feat2)

% funtion returns the score (correlation) between all the rows of feat1 with
% all the rows of feat2, ensure data is centred before.
% for Score(i,j), the row i corresponds to the scores of the ith feature of
% feat1, the column j corresponds to the score of the jth feature of feat2

% if one set of features provided, scores are compared with itself
if nargin == 1
    feat2 = feat1 ;
end

% find number of features
l1 = size(feat1,1) ;
l2 = size(feat2,1) ;

% normalise each feature to length 1, saves calculating norm for each
% iteration
feat1 = normr(feat1) ;
feat2 = normr(feat2) ;

% prebuild score matrix to save time
Score = zeros(l1,l2) ;

% if finding score with itself, scores will be symmetrical across the
% diagonal, so avoid repeat calculations

        for j = i:l2
            Score(i,j) = (feat1(i,:) * feat2(j,:)') ;
